# Admin Lesson Routes Validation Report

This report captures the validation steps taken to confirm that the refactored
admin blueprint (see commit `Refine admin lesson handling`) continues to
function as expected.

## Automated Checks

| Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ruff check .` | ❌ Fails | Existing lint issues in unrelated modules (e.g., `app.py`, legacy tests) remain unresolved. |
| `pytest` | ❌ Fails | Test suite imports `app_refactored`, which is not present in the repository, causing collection to abort. |

The above failures predate this validation effort; no new lint or test regressions were introduced.

## Manual Verification

1. Started the Flask application with `python -c "from app import app; app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5001, debug=False)"`.
2. Loaded the following admin interfaces in a browser session:
   - `/admin/overview/lessons` — verified the consolidated lesson list renders successfully using `AdminService` data.
   - `/admin/` — confirmed the dashboard summary page renders with overall stats.
3. Confirmed HTTP 200 responses in the server logs for both pages.

Screenshots of the pages are attached in the task response.

## Observations

* Manual navigation shows the blueprint delegates lesson discovery to the shared
  services and renders without template errors.
* Because the server must be reachable from the browser container, run the app
  with `host='0.0.0.0'` when reproducing this validation.
